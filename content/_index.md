Hi. My name is Petr. I make [synths](https://zlosynth.com/).
I figured it may be useful to future me, and others, to write down how I do
things. Things like programming, signal processing, audio hardware, and maybe
other things too.

If you'd like to talk, feel free to text me at
[petr\@zlosynth.com](mailto:petr@zlosynth.com?subject=Synthmaking).
